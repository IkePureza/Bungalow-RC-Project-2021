# Bungalow-RC-Project-2021
Melbourne engineering students passion project to create a RC car and controller from scratch 
## The Team
- Mechanical Engineer: [Samuel Creati]()
- Industrial Designer: [Daniel Nguyen]()
- Mechatronics Engineer: [Henrique Pureza]()
- Operations Engineer: [Justing Nguyen]()
## Aim and Premise
- To design and build an electronic RC car that features **consistent** RC communication, **reliable** steering, **quick** response times, **robust** suspension and **high** acceleration/torque while offering **modularity** of the chassis and mechanical parts.
- To build a **portable** and **handheld** RC controller that is **programmable** (and thus, **universal**) which can communicate **effortlessly** to the radio tranceiver on the RC car
## Road map

## Terminology
- Bottom plate – A rigid structure that sits on the floor of the car and is where most of the vehicle’s internals are attached
-Chassis – The main body of the vehicle that is bolted to the bottom plate
- RC controller – The device that allows control of the RC car via radio transmission
- RC transmitter – The component inside the RC controller which emits radio signals
- RC transceiver – The electronics in the RC car that receives and processes incoming radio signals
 ## Design
 > Top down design approach will be used on this project
